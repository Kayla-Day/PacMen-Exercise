#PacMen Exercise
## Populate the browser with unlimited pacmen

## Description 
A factory to create as many PacMen as you choose to add, that will move around the browser at their own speed.

## How to Run
When 'make one' is pressed a pacman will appear; there is no limit on how many pacmen you can create. When 'move' is pressed, any pacmen you've created will move about the screen at various speeds.

## Future improvements
I would like to work on having the pacmen 'chomping' across the screen as their moving as well as change direction once they bounce off the edge of the browser screen.
